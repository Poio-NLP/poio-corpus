Poio - Open Source Technology for Language Diversity
====================================================

The Poio project develops language technologies to support communication in
lesser-used and under-resourced languages on and with electronic devices.
Within the Poio project we develop text input services with text prediction and
transliteration for mobile devices and desktop users to allow conversation in
hundreds of languages between individuals and in online communities. Poio
started as a language revitalization project at the Interdisciplinary Centre
for Social and Language Documentation in Minde/Portugal, a non-profit
organization dedicated to the documentation and preservation of linguistic
heritage.

You can try the text prediction on the official website of Poio:

Poio consists of several open source projects to process and manage language
data, to extract corpora from diverse data sources and to calculate language
models for the online tools. You can find a list of all Poio projects on the
our Github organization page:
